Lorax: Hello, everybody. Thanks for coming. (reads the note) I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. And I'd like to say a few words, if you please. Regarding the story that you're about to see. It actually happened. Just take it from me. But there's more to this story than what's on the page, so please pay attention while I set the stage.

(Curtain opens to Thneedville.)

Lorax: [v.o.] We open in Thneedville, a city they say that was plastic and fake, and they liked it that way! A town without nature, not one living tree. So, what happened to them? Cue the music! Let's see.

Bee: Buzz. Buzz.

In Thneedville,
it's a brand new dawn
With brand new cars
and houses and lawns
Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville
In Thneedville,
we manufacture our trees
Each one is made
in factories
And uses 96 batteries
In Thneedville,
the air's not so clean
So we buy it fresh
It comes out this machine!
In Satisfaction's-
guaranteed-ville
In Thneedville,
we don't want to know
Where the smog and trash
and chemicals go
I just went swimming,
and now I glow
In Thneedville,
we have fun year round
We surf and snowboard
right in town
We thank the Lord
for all we've got
Including this
brand new parking lot!
Parking lot!
Oh, look,
it's Aloysius O'Hare
Aloysius O'Hare
The man who found
a way to sell air
And became a zillionaire
Hip-hip-hooray!
In Thneedville,
we love living this way
It's like living in paradise
It's perfect!
And that's how it will stay
Oh, yeah!
Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville
Destined-to-succeed-ville
We-are-all-agreed-ville
We love it here in...
Thneedville!
Yes!
Oh, hi, Ted.
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.
Did your ball land
in my backyard again?
What? No.
A model airplane,
this time.
Hey, do you want to
see something cool?
Come on.
Whoa!
Did you...
Did you paint this?
Do you like it?
What?
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!
What are those?
Those are trees.
Real ones.
They used to grow
all around here.
And people said that
the touch of their tufts
was softer than
anything, even silk.
And they smelled
like butterfly milk!
Wow! What does
that even mean?
I know, right?
Oh, yeah.
What I want more than anything
in the whole world is to see
a real living tree
growing in my backyard.
So if, say... I'm just
thinking out loud here.
If a guy somehow
got you one...
I'd probably
marry him on the spot.
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?
No! Not crazy.
Not crazy at all.


Cut to Ted's family having dinner. Ted is seen poking his food, looking bored.



Ted's Mom: Ted, honey, don't play with your food. You, either, Mom.



Cut to Granny Norma bobbing her food before flicking it into her mouth.



Ted: So, Mom, do you happen to know if there's any place where I could get a real tree?

Ted's Mom: Ted, we already have a tree. It's the latest model.

Ted: Yeah, but I mean a real one that grows out of the ground or whatever. You know, a real tree.
Ted's Mom: Really? You would rather have some dirty, messy lump of wood that just sticks out of the ground? And it does what? I don't even know what it does. What's its purpose? Look at what we've got. [gestures to the Oak-amatic] It's the Oak-amatic. The only tree with its own remote. Summer, autumn, winter, and disco!
Ted: Mom?
Ted's Mom: Come on, Ted. Get into it. Dance with the tree.
Ted: Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop. [the music stops] So, anyway... Let's just say I need a tree. Where would I go? What do I do?
Granny Norma: Then you know what? You need to find the Once-ler. [starts slicing her food]
Ted: [stammering] The what?
Ted's Mom: Mom, it's not really the time for one of your magical fables, okay?
Granny Norma: That's right, I forgot. I'm old and can't even remember to put my teeth in.
Ted's Mom: Stand down. That's not what I meant.
Granny Norma: No, really, I forgot my teeth. Would you be a dear and go get them for me?
Ted's Mom: [sighs] Sure, Mom. [leaves the kitchen]
As soon as Ted's Mom left, Granny Norma finds her teeth and puts them in her mouth.
Granny Norma: Okay, here's the deal. The Once-ler is the man who knows what happened to the trees. You want one, you need to find him.
Ted: The Once-ler? Mmm-hmm. Okay. Grammy, is this a real thing that we're talking about now?
Granny Norma: Oh, he's real all right.
Ted: Well, where can I find him? [shrieks]
Granny Norma: Far outside of town where the grass never grows and the wind smells slow and sour when it blows. And no birds ever sing, excepting old crows.
Ted: [shrieks] Quit doing that.
That's the place where the Once-ler lives.
Wait, outside of town?
People used to say if you brought him 15 cents,
a nail
and the shell of a great,
great, great grandfather snail,
he would tell you everything.
Hmm.
Mr. O'Hare, what we've got for you is something that is going to take O'Hare Air to the next level.
Now, Mr. O'Hare, I know what you're thinking.
One, " I've gotten rich selling people air that's "fresher than the stinky stuff outside. "
Two, and here is the important one, "How can I possibly make even more money?"
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.
Check out this commercial, huh?

Well, here goes another lame Saturday.
Dude, I don't think so!
Huh!
Hey!
Man!
Oh, yeah!
What!
Yeah!
O'Hare purified air.
Freshness to go.
Please breathe responsibly.
Ah?
Oh, my goodness. Yeah!
Love it.
You got to be kidding me.
You really think people are
stupid enough to buy this?
Our research shows that if you
put something in a plastic bottle,
people will buy it.
Exactly. And...
And what's more, when
we build a new factory
to make
the plastic bottles,
the air quality is
just going to get worse.
Which will make people
want our air even more,
and drive sales where?
Through the roof!
So, in other words,
the more smog in the sky,
The more people will buy.
See, that's why he's the
genius! It even rhymes!
I'm aware it rhymes.
Coats. Big.
What do you two
knuckleheads want?
I'm in the middle
of a meeting!
What?
Why is he leaving town?
No one ever leaves town!
See what he's up to.
Whoa!
Huh?
Whoa! Whoa.
Oh, man.
Whoa!
All right.
Okay.
What the...
Whoa!
[Ted gets pulled up by a rope and pulley to the second floor window where the Once-ler confronts him angrily.]
Once-ler: Who are you? Who are you and what are you doing here?!
Ted: I'm Ted. I'm Ted. I can't breathe. Are you the Once-ler? Oh, man.
Once-ler: Didn't you read the signs? No one is supposed to come here. Get out of here and leave me alone! And don't let the boot hit you on the way out.
Ted: The boot? [gets kicked by said boot from behind] Hello! Ow!
Listen! People say that if someone brings you this stuff that you will tell them about trees. [gets grabbed again] No, no, no!
Once-ler: Trees?
Ted: Yeah, real ones. You know, that grow out of the ground? [pause] Hello?
Once-ler: Sorry, it's just... Well, I didn't think anyone still cared about trees.
Ted: Well, that's me. The guy who still cares. I'm here. [gets put back down] Hey! What?
Once-ler: Do you want to know about trees? About what happened to them? Why they're all gone? [sighs] It's because of me.
Ted: [confused] Wait, what?
In response, the Once-ler drops the Chute-ma-phone down for Ted to understand him.
Once-ler: [shouting] It's because of me! [Ted coughs] And my invention, the Thneed. It was an amazing product that could do the job of a thousand.
Ted: All right. Sounds ridiculous, but I mean, that's cool.
Once-ler: You're darn right it was cool! It all started a long time ago.
Ted: Can we start not so long ago, maybe?
Once-ler: Do you want a tree?
Ted: Yes, yes.
Once-ler: Then it all started a long, long time ago.
[scene flashes back to the Once-ler as a young man]
Once-ler: I was a young man leaving home.

Well, here I go, Mom. Off to change the world with my Thneed. I'm actually doing it!
Yes, but just remember, Oncie, if somehow your invention ends up a failure instead of a success, oh, it wouldn't surprise me at all!
Nice wheels.
Burn!
Ow!
Yeah, "Burn!"
But you will see, okay? I'm
going to prove you all wrong.
Come on, Melvin!
So, there I was
at the very bottom.
With nothing
but a wagon, a mule,
and a completely irrational
sense of optimism.
I was searching the globe,
obsessed with finding the
perfect material for my Thneed.
But I'd had
absolutely no success.
Until one day, I found paradise.
Oh!
We're going to be there soon, I'm sure.
Whoa!
This is the most beautiful place, okay, I have ever seen.
Oh.
Ta-da!
Whoa!
Yeah
This is it!
This is the place
These Truffula trees
are just what I need
Gonna chop one down
and make my Thneed
But first...
Now you!
That's great!
So now our
friendship can begin
Hand in hand,
and wing and fin
There's nothing
you and I can't do
So let's all make
my dreams come true
Hey, guys!
Come on, where is my back-up chorus?
What?
Ah-ha! Oh.
Ooh!
Ted: [interrupting the story] Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute.
Once-ler: Excuse me?
Ted: [chuckles] Yeah. That's awesome. You know, feeding junk food to forest animals? That's great. But, uh, is there a musical number where you show me how to get a tree? 'Cause I'd love to hear that one.
Once-ler: Oh, yes. Right after the musical number about the kid who kept interrupting the story and was never heard from ever again. Hmm?
Ted: Right. Got it. Proceed.
Once-ler: All right, here we go. About to make a Thneed, about to change the world.

Once-ler: Check it out, guys... Where did everybody go?

Once-ler: Little did I know that by chopping down that tree I had just summoned a mystical creature as old as time itself. The legendary, slightly annoying guardian of the forest.The Lorax.

[The Lorax, along with the Swomee-Swans, the Bar-ba-loots, and the Humming-Fish, place stones around the stump to honor the tragic loss to the forest.]

The Lorax: [first meets Once-ler] Hey!
[Once-ler shrieks and falls backwards]
The Lorax: Did you chop down this tree?
Once-ler: Uhh... No. Who did it?ǃ [gasps] What's that? [the Lorax looks back and Once-ler drops his axe on Pipsqueak the Bar-ba-loot] I think he did it.
Lorax: [growls] Leave! Vacate the premises! Take your axe and get out!
Once-ler: And who are you? [pokes the Lorax]
Lorax: Hey, hey! I-I'm the Lorax, guardian of the forest. I speak for the trees. [The Once-ler stares at him] So, you're telling me, that you didn't see me magically appear out of that stump? With all the lightning and thunder and stuff. You didn't see any of that?
Once-ler: No, but that sounds amazing. Can I see some of that?
Lorax: Uhh, yeah, I could show you. But that's not how it works.
Okay. Um...
Didn't really happen.
Oh, I know what you want!
I've got one of these for the
cutest little guy I ever saw!
Yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy...
How dare you!
Give me that!
Mmm.
I'm going to eat this,
but I am highly
offended by it.
What are you... Hey,
Mustache! Will you stop that?
What's your deal, man?
Time for you to go,
Beanpole! Pull them right out.
Just going to put them right
back in. We can do this all day.
Stop right there! Stop it!
So you would hammer one of
nature's innocent creatures?
Once-ler: [After the Lorax accuses him of harming Pipsqueak after almost hitting him with a hammer] What? No! I would never hit this little guy. You, on the other hand, I would gladly pound you and your mustache into the ground!
Behold! The intruder
and his violent ways.
Shame on you.
For shame!
All right, you know what? That's it!
You listen to me,
you furry meatloaf.
I'm going to chop down as
many trees as I need. Okay?
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!
End of story.
Then you
leave me no choice.
If you're not gone by the time
the sun sets on this valley,
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you
and curse you until
the end of your days!
You have been warned.
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.
You have been warned.
But I didn't listen
to his warning.
And you won't believe
what happened that night.
What?
If you want to hear more,
come back tomorrow.
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?
Whoa!
Whoa-ho-ho.
Are you serious right now?
Ah! You live in
the middle of nowhere!
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!
I guess you don't really want
to hear the rest of the story.
No, no.
I do. I really do. I want
to hear the story. I just...
Nah! You don't have
what it takes. Goodbye.
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.
It's all right. It's
okay, I'll come back.
It's no problem.
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Mmm.
Maybe. Just maybe.
What did you
wish for, Audrey?
Well, I would
love to tell you,
but, sadly, according to the
universal wish laws, I cannot.
I know
what she wished for.
Was it, perhaps...
This?
Ted, you didn't.
Oh, no. I totally did.
Happy birthday, Audrey.
Kiss him! Kiss him!
Ted.
Ted. Tedster.
Huh!
You're kissing the
cereal again, hon. What?
I just...
I like this cereal.
What one is this?
Yeah!
Okay.
Well, I'll make sure to
buy extra next time for you.
All right, cool. Hey, I got
to run. I got to go do a thing.
So, I'll see you guys.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You're not going
anywhere, young man.
It's Sunday.
You know what that means?
Family time, and we're
all playing board games!
But...
Hmm.
Mmm?
Oh, man.
Mom, seriously,
every turn?
Hey, back off!
Ooh!
No.
Okay! Family time is over.
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.
Okay, dear. Have fun.
I knew
I could break her.
Go.
Huh?
Go see him!
Oh, yeah!
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.
Whoa!
Hey! Ted, right?
Um, Mr. O'Hare?
So, I hear you have
become interested in trees.
What's that all about?
Oh. Um...
Where did you hear that?
Oh.
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville
that I don't know about.
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.
Trees?
They make it for free.
So, when I hear
people talking about them,
I consider it kind of
a threat to my business.
I don't even know
what you're talking about.
You listen to me, boy.
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!
Yeah, um...
Okay, my mom is expecting
me. So, I'm just going to...
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.
Grandma just
finished her turn.
How did you know?
Please. I have
eyes everywhere.
Huh!
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.
Why, I can't
think of any reason
you would ever want to
go outside of town again.
Ever.
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.
Oh, no.
Look out!
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.
Oh, you missed me.
What?
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.
Once-ler: Why are you so interested in trees anyway? Why aren't you like other kids? Break-dancing and wearing bell-bottoms and playing the Donkey Kongs?
Ted: [laughs] Yeah. Right, right. I don't know. Uh, I just thought it might be kinda cool to have one, you know.
Once-ler: [knowingly] Aaah, it's a girl, isn't it?
Ted: [scoffs] What? No!
Once-ler: Really? 'Cause when a guy does something stupid once, well, that's because he's a guy, but if he does the same stupid thing twice, that's usually to impress some girl.
Ted: [about Audrey] Hey, she is not some girlǃ She's a woman… in high school… and she loves trees, and I'm gonna get her one.
Once-ler: Aww. How nice to see someone so undeterred by things like reality.
Ted: (sincerely) Thank you.
All right,
but where did we leave off?
Now that's a Thneed.
Nothing unmanly
about knitting. No, sir.
Look at that...
Oh!
Who taught you guys
how to steal a bed?
Shh!
[The Humming-Fish sing the Mission: Impossible theme.]
Okay, nice and easy.
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't
have done it without you.
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?
Of course he can't swim!
Hang on, Pipsqueak!
I'm coming to get you!
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!
Whoo! Whoo!
Jump, jump!
Come on, get up there.
Come on.
Go, go! A little bit
more! A little bit more!
Now what?
Mmm-mmm.
Get up there.
Okay, Pipsqueak,
give me your hand.
Come on,
reach out for the Lorax.
Where did you go?
Bar-ba-loots.
Oh, that's bad.
[The Humming-Fish sing the Funeral March as The Once-ler floats down the river sleeping on his bed.]
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!
What's happening?
Where am I?
Hey! We got trouble,
and it's coming up fast!
Whoo!
We're in a river!
Whew!
Oh, no.
Just do something!
Help is on the way!
No, no!
Just a minute!
Oh, no!
Wake up! Wake up!
Yuck!
Clear!
Ah!
I was heading
into the light,
and you pulled me
right back and here I am!
You saved my life!
Yeah, I know. Well, no,
it's not that big a deal.
It is a big deal!
Look, I almost went over
that waterfall! Wait...
On my bed. How did my
bed get in the river?
Uh... About that...
Actually... I put your bed in the water.
I didn't
mean you any harm.
I just wanted to
calmly float you away.
Look, everyone here
needs the trees
and you're
chopping them down!
So, we've got
a big problem.
All right, look.
I hereby swear that I will
never chop down another tree.
I promise.
Thank you. But I'm going
to keep my eye on you.
Good. Now, I've got
a big day tomorrow
so I'm going to
get some sleep.
Right after
I find my bed.

Once-ler: [screams and wakes up, a screaming Lorax also screams and wakes up, punching his nose] Ow! Okay, what are you...? Question, what are they doing here? And follow up, if I may, what are YOU doing here?!
The Lorax: Well, after the incident last night, we found one of your socks and came here to return it. But when we got here, you were asleep.
Once-ler: What? Exactly. And sleeping is the body's way of telling other people to go away.
Lorax: I know, but you looked so cozy. And it was cold outside, and we just fell asleep. No harm done.
Once-ler: "No harm done"? "No harm done"? Okay. [finds a Humming-Fish bathing himself in a coffee mug] Okay, I put my lips on those. Well, I used to, anyway. [sees a Swomee-Swan lay an egg] Ew. Did you just...In my bowl?!
Lorax: [brushing his mustache with the Once-ler's toothbrush] Why do you even own this? You don't have a mustache.
Once-ler: Okay, that's it!
Lorax: What? I thought we made a deal last night.
Once-ler: Yes, we did. And I said I wouldn't chop down any more trees.
Lorax: And I said I was going to keep an eye on you. I'm starving! What's for breakfast? [opens the fridge, seeing a fat Bar-ba-loot showly shoving a stick of butter into his mouth] Breakfast is overrated. [closes the fridge door]
Once-ler: [grunts in frustrated] You know what? I got work to do. [strips out of his pajamas in front of the Lorax and into his outfit] Yep! I got to go into town and sell my Thneed!
Lorax: [when the Once-ler shows the Thneed to him; laughs] You chopped down one of my trees to make that piece of garbage? Look at that...
"Garbage"? Oh, no.
Oh, no! You do not get it.
This is
a revolutionary product
that will change
the world as we know it.
It has a million uses!
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit!
Mud tracked all over your
floor by uninvited guests?
Well, the Thneed sure
comes in handy for that!
But wait, there's more!
Thanks to its
all-natural microfibers,
the Thneed is
super-absorbent!
It also works as a hat.
Of course, you probably
want to wring it out first.
Go ahead,
knock yourself out.
But nobody is going
to buy that thing.
Good to know.
Well, fortunately, you are
not the target market, weirdo.
You're bringing a guitar?
Oh, yeah.
I got a little jingle.
I'm gonna blow some minds,
gonna sell some Thneeds!
Yeah.
Everybody
needs a Thneed
A fine thing
that all people...
Sit down, go on.
Unfortunately, I didn't
sell it the first day.
The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great...
Hey!
Or the second day.
Hey!
Or the third,
or fourth, or fifth day.
Okay, that one
hit the tender spot.
Until finally...
That's it!
You know what?
I'm done with this thing.
Aw.
My family was right.
I quit!
Hey. Cool hat.
Oh, my gosh!
I totally want one.
That thing makes me
like you more.
Hey! Where's your Thneed,
did you sell it?
Hey. No, no.
Didn't sell it.
Turns out, it's ahead
of its time, I guess.
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?
Come on, take a seat,
we'll deal you in.
What are we playing?
I'm playing poker. He's playing
Go Fish. And I think he's hungry.
Oh.
Pancake, the pancake
Up!
Who is up for ninths?
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Whoa!
All right, pass them over.
Yeah, see?
What's going on?
Oh, no.
That's a lot of people.
Everybody
needs a Thneed
A fine thing
that all people need
The Thneed is good
The Thneed is great
Let's hope we're not too late
It's a super trendy hat
It's a tightrope
for an acrobat
A net for
catching butterflies
A thing we use for exercise
Everybody needs a Thneed
A fine thing
that all people need
Everybody needs a Thneed
Oh, yeah!
We're in business, baby!
We need a Thneed
Mom? Hey, it's me! I told you
I was going to be a success!
You need to bring the
whole family here right now.
We're going to be rich!
What? I'm going to need all
the help I can get. Don't worry.
So, has he told you
how to get a tree yet?
Actually, no.
But I think he's going to
get to that part really soon.
Here we are.
What?
I'll just be a minute.
Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!
Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.
Just me and my thoughts.
Oh, is this the girl
you're always talking about?
Grandma!
Stop making things up.
She's even prettier than...
Okay, got to run! Bye.
Okay, Grammy,
let's get you home!
Yeah!
Whoa!
I'm so sorry. So sorry.
Did not wanna see that.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa-ho-ho!
Hey!
Hey, I'm back.
What have you got there?
Yes!
Whoa!
Thank you, Ted.
Now, picture this.
Sun shining, a blue sky, a perfect day.
It was all downhill from there.
Whoa!
What a dump.
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!
Hey, Chet, check this out!
Go long!
No, Brett,
that's actually not a...
Okay.
Go long! Go long!
I got it! I got it!
Got it!
He totally ran
into that tree!
Ow!
Oncie, is that you?
Mom!
There he is! There's my
big, suddenly successful son!
We always knew you would
make it, Oncie. Right?
Hey! I love this guy!
But you always said I wouldn't
amount to anything, remember?
Hush your mouth. I was
just trying to motivate you!
I am really glad
that you clarified that
because it actually hurt my
feelings for a really long time.
Anyway, you're all here, you
all work for me, and that's cool.
So, let's get to work.
Brett, Chet,
set up the RV!
Would you stop
throwing that bear?
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move
an inch. Nobody's moving in here.
You got to go. Goodbye.
Aunt Grizelda: [referring to the Lorax] So, who invited the giant furry peanut?
Lorax: You callin' me a peanut, huh? I'll go right up your nose!
Aunt Grizelda: Ha! [advances on him]
Once-ler: Whoa, whoa, whoa! You wouldn't hit a woman.
Lorax: [gasps] That's a woman...?ǃ
Okay.
Everyone, cool it.
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot here.
Um, family, this is my
friend... Acquaintance.
Yeah, acquaintance. Very
good acquaintance, the Lorax.
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.
And on behalf
of the trees, get out!
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.
And I'm going to
need their help
if my company is
going to get bigger. Okay?
Bigger?
Yeah, this isn't some
rinky-dink operation anymore.
I got plans. Big plans!
A vision of a world filled with
Thneeds. It's going to be huge!
Which way
does a tree fall?
Uh, down?
A tree falls
the way it leans.
Be careful
which way you lean.

Once-ler: I mean, look at this. It's amazing. I am so proud of me.
Once-ler's Mom: Oncie, we've got us a little problem.
Once-ler:  Problem?
Once-ler's Mom: Mmm-hmm. See, we're not making Thneeds fast enough.
Harvesting the tufts takes too long!

Once-ler: Well, what else can we do?
Once-ler's Mom: Well, and this just came to me, we could always start chopping down the trees.
Once-ler: What?
Now you're thinking.
That would speed things up!
Once-ler: But...
Once-ler's Mom: No buts, Oncie. You're running a business now. You have to do what's best for the company and your momma.
Once-ler: Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to chop down a few trees.
Once-ler's Mom: You've made me so proud, Oncie. Come here!
Hey! I love this guy!

No! No, no, no!
Stop it! Please, stop.
Take that, you stupid tree!

Where do you
think you're going?
Excuse me, sir. I need
to talk with your boss.

Oh, I'm sorry,
but Mr. Once-ler's
not seeing anyone right now.
Yeah, well,
he'll see me. So...
Hey, keep your
paws off me!
Give me a reason, Shorty.
Hey, you broke
your promise.
You're better than this.
You gotta stop!
This is bad!
Have a nice day!
Bad?
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy
here. He just doesn't get it.
Do you think I'm bad?
Thank you!
I mean, something good
finally happens to me,
and he just has to come
along and rain on my parade.
What's his problem?
See?
Yeah, bad! Right.
How bad can I be?

How bad can I be?
I'm just following my destiny

Just look at me
petting this puppy
How bad can I be?
A portion of proceeds
goes to charity
How bad can I be?
How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!
[Closing How Bad Can I Be] All the customers are buying, and the money's multiplying, and the PR people are lying, [A Thneed is thrown on the Lorax as a picture is taken. A billboard featuring the picture reads "Lorax Approved"] and the lawyers are denying. Who cares if a few trees are dying? This is all so gratifying! How bad, how bad can this possibly be?!

Lorax: So, how are things?

Once-ler: What are you doing here?
Lorax: Happy yet? You fill that hole deep down inside you? Or do you still need more?
Once-ler: Look, if you've got a problem with what I'm doing, why haven't you used your quote-unquote powers to stop me?
Lorax: I told you, that's not how it works.
Once-ler: Right, I forgot. You're a fraud. I need you to get out. Now!
Lorax: Why? Do I make you uncomfortable? Remind you of the promises you made? The man you used to be?
Once-ler: [To the Lorax] You know what? You can just shut your mustache! My conscience is clear. I have done nothing illegal, and I mean no harm. But I have my rights, and I intend to keep on biggering and biggering, and turning more Truffula trees in to Thneeds which everyone wants because everyone needs! And nothing, no, NOTHING is going to stop me!

Lorax: [when the last Truffula tree is chopped down] That's it. The very last one. That may stop you.

Somebody sure made a bundle on that thing. I wonder what the next million dollar invention's going to be.
Yeah, I wonder...

Son, you have let me down. Brett, you are now my favorite child.

Hey, look, I don't want any trouble.
Lorax:And you won't get any. Not from them.

Thanks to you and your hacking, and smogging and glupping, they can't live here anymore.

Lorax: So, I'm sending them off. Hopefully, they'll be able to find a better place out there somewhere.

Once-ler: Melvin? Melvin... Hey, Pipsqueak... Hey...

So, this is really all your fault. You destroyed everything.
Yes. And each day since the Lorax left, I've sat here regretting everything I've done, staring at that word, "unless," and wondering what it meant. But now I'm thinking... Well, maybe you're the reason the Lorax left that word there.
Me? Why would he leave that for me?
[To Ted] Because Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better... It's not.

The last Truffula seed. You need to plant it, Ted.
Yeah, but, nobody cares about trees anymore.
Once-ler: Then make them care. Plant the seed in the middle of town, where everyone can see. [To Ted; referring to the last Truffula seed] Change the way things are. I know it may seem small and insignificant, but it's not about what it is, it's about what it can become. That's not just a seed... any more than you're just a boy.

I won't let you down.
I know.

Hey, Audrey!
Audrey!
Ted?
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.
Wait, but...
My house, okay?
Got to plant the seed.
Okay, we're going
to need water.
And uh,
something to dig with.
Um, what do I have...
Ted?
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.
Theodore Wiggins,
get down here right now,
and I am not
kidding with you!
Ted, I would like
you to meet Mr. O'Hare,
the most powerful
man in town.
There he is!
Hello, Ted.
Uh...
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?
He knows his own name and everything.
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?
A delicious cookie.
Wonderful.
Teddy and I'll
stay here and talk.
Sure, why don't you
go ahead and adopt him?
I'm just kidding. That was
a joke. I was just joking.
I'll get your cookie.
I know you have it, Ted.
So, let's put an end
to this nonsense, shall we?
Hand it over.
I'm sorry...
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Really? Well, then...
I guess you wouldn't mind
us checking your room.
No, no, no!
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!
No, you can't go up there!
Guys, this is
ridiculous. Stop!
Hey!
No, you can't
come in my room!
Find it!
Find it!
What is going on here?
Aloysius O'Hare: [to Mrs. Wiggins, after she comes up stairs and what's going on] THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU! Get back downstairs!
Excuse me, down there!
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby-man!
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.
Fine. Sorry.
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.
And my apologies, Ted.
You be safe.
Mind telling me
what's going on here?
The seed! Where is it?
Seed?
Where's Grammy?
It's alive!
I remember you.
Ted, what...
Audrey!
Hey, did you want to...
Well, okay!
Ted, what is this about?
It's about this.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that... Yes. The last Truffula seed.
And you're going to help me plant
it right in the middle of town
where everyone can see it.
Audrey: [to Ted] I could just kiss you right now! [Ted and Audrey lean in to kiss, but Ted's mother stops them]
Mrs. Wiggins: We don't have time for that!
Ted: I dunno, we have a little time. [Audrey and his mom stare at him] You know what? Let's just go. Let's go. Forget about it.
Maniac!
Hey!
Ah!
Here it comes!
I'm going for it.
Oh, hello!

Ted, big scary blimp coming.
Whoa!
Aloysius O'Hare: [going after Ted and his girlfriend and grandma after the Truffula seed, through a megaphone] YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS, BOY! BAM!
Bam!
Go faster, you idiot!
Yeah!
Step on it, Ted!
Whoa!
You're fired!
Whoa! Ted, look out!
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...
This is not good.
How's it doing?
Whoa-ho-ho!
Loser!
Oh, really?
Oh, no. The seed!
Get that seed!
Hang on! Here we go!
Grammy!
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?
No!
Come on!
Yeah, that's right.
There it is!
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!
Ah!
Hey, ow, ow!
Oh, come on!
What the...
Get it unstuck,
get it unstuck!
Bring it on, Teddy!
You don't have the guts!
Ted!
Grammy!
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! It's Mr. O...
Take that, shorty!
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.
No, Grammy...
Hey, get out of there!
Ah!
Hey!
What?
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?
Hey, they broke
O'Hare's head!
What do you think
you're doing, kid?
Um, I'm looking for
a place to plant a tree.
A real one.
Why would we
need a tree?
Exactly.
Oh, man.
Folks...
The last thing you
want around here is trees.
They're filthy!
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.
They bring poisonous ants
and stinging bees.
Hey!
Ouch.
Think about the kids.
And, I just thought,
you know, they make leaves!
You know that, right?
Then these leaves,
they just fall.
They just fall
wherever they want!
Come on! We know why
you're really against trees.
Because they
produce fresh air.
For free!
Oh!
I am wounded!
You have lied!
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.
Come on.
She's making that up!
That's a
made-up word, people!
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.
We don't need trees!
That boy has a seed.
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!
O'Hare is right!
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!
Where do you think
you're going?
Come on, let's go!
Get in, get in!
Hey!
Stop that maniac!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!
Yeah. I know.
Wow. Did you see that?
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

Ted: I am Ted Wiggins. And I speak for the trees. And the fact is, things aren't perfect here in Thneedville. And they're only going to get worse, unless we do something about it, unless we change our ways. And we can start by planting this!

Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.
Right?
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed!
People, come on!
You! Get out there right now
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!
Go on, tell them
what you think.
You don't know me,
but my name's Cy
I'm just
the O'Hare delivery guy
But it seems like
trees might be worth a try
So I say let it grow
My name is Dan
And my name's Rose
Our son Wesley kind of glows
And that's not good,
so we suppose
We should let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap
what you don't sow
Plant a seed inside the Earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth
We say let it grow
My name's Marie,
and I am three!
I would really
like to see a tree
I say let it grow
I'm Grammy Norma I'm old,
and I've got gray hair
But I remember when
trees were everywhere
And no one
had to pay for air
So I say let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
Like it did so long ago
It is just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to change
the life we lead
Time to let it grow
My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you
I live here
in Thneedville, too
The things you say
just might be true
It could be time to start anew
And maybe change
my point of view
Nah! I say let it die!
Let it die, let it die
Let it shrivel up and...
Come on, who's with me?
Nobody.
You greedy dirt-bag!
Let it grow, let it grow
Let the love inside you show
Plant a seed inside the Earth
Just one way to know its worth
Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth
We say let it grow
Let it grow, let it grow
You can't reap
what you don't sow
It's just one tiny seed
But it's all we really need
It's time to
banish all your greed
Imagine Thneedville
flowered and treed
Let this be our solemn creed
Once-ler: [opens the window for the first time as he hears the city singing "Let it Grow" and is on the verge of tears] Thank you, Ted.
We say let it grow
In Thneedville
We say let it grow
It's a brand new dawn
We say let it grow
In Thneedville
We say let it grow
It's a brand new dawn

The Lorax: You done good, Beanpole. You done good.
[The Once-ler hugs The Lorax]
Lorax: By the way, nice mustache.
